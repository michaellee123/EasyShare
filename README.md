Your devcies should been connected to same Wi-Fi.

Then, you can copy the url and open in your browser to download. But, the most convenient way is use your smartphone to scan this QRCode.

Do not click the `完成` button before the download is completed, otherwise the link will be disconnected.

That's all, everything is so easy!

## For Pro Man

The default http port is 12580, if you want to change it, you can search `EasyShare.sqlite` and change something.

## Something New

I found masOS's `ShareExtension` can used in Safari and other browers. So you can share web page by `EasyShare` now. Just click right-top button in Safari, and select `EasyShare`, you will got a QRCode, then you can scan to visit this web page in your smartphone. Like this.

But I don't kown how to get the web page's title, and Apple provide no document. So, let it be. haha :)
