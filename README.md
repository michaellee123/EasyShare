## Install

Download the release package and unzip it, copy the EasyShare.app into Applications dir. This app is just some tips.

Open System Preferences -> Extensions -> Share Menu, and select EasyShare.

## Use

Open the finder, select the file you want to share, right-click, then select share -> EasyShare, you will see a QR code on your screen, like this.

Your devices should be connected to the same Wi-Fi.

Then, you can copy the URL and open it in your browser to download. But, the most convenient way is to use your smartphone to scan this QR code.

Do not click the `完成` button before the download is completed, otherwise, the link will be disconnected.

That's all, everything is so easy!

## For Pro Man

The default HTTP port is 12580, if you want to change it, you can search `EasyShare.sqlite` and change something.

## Something New

I found macOS's `ShareExtension` can used in Safari and other browsers. So you can share web pages by `EasyShare` now. Just click the right-top button in Safari, and select `EasyShare`, you will get a QR code, then you can scan it to visit this web page on your smartphone, like this.

But I don't know how to get the web page's title, and Apple provides no document. So, let it be. haha :)

## One More Thing

There is a way to send a file from Android to Mac, [Check here for download `AndDrop`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neure.anddrop).
